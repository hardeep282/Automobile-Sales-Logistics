Customer Value & Shipping Risk Intelligence

Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Power BI
Domain: Sales Analytics | Marketing Analytics | Operational Intelligence

📌 Project Objective

To build a data-driven customer intelligence model that combines customer value (RFM segmentation) with logistics performance (shipping reliability) in order to identify:

High-value customers at fulfilment risk

Stable VIP customers

Upsell opportunities

Operational inefficiencies affecting revenue retention

📂 Dataset Overview

Customer-level dataset derived from automobile sales transactions containing:

Recency of purchase

Purchase frequency

Revenue contribution

Product variety

Average order value (MSRP)

Shipping success ratio

Key geography and product categories

🧠 Key Analytical Layers
1️⃣ RFM Segmentation

Customers were segmented into High, Mid, and Low Value tiers based on:

Recency (days since last purchase)

Frequency (number of orders)

Monetary (total revenue generated)

This formed the core customer valuation layer.

2️⃣ Shipping Reliability Intelligence

A shipping reliability score was calculated for each customer using historical fulfilment success rates.
Customers were further grouped into:

Reliable

Minor Issues

Unreliable

Critical

3️⃣ Composite Value × Shipping Segmentation

By combining RFM value tiers with shipping reliability, strategic business segments were formed, such as:

High Value – Fulfilment Risk

High Value – Stable

Mid Value – Risk

Low Priority Customers

This layer directly supports:

Retention strategy

Logistics optimisation

Revenue protection

4️⃣ Behavioural Clustering (K-Means)

K-Means clustering was applied on:

RFM features

Shipping reliability

Product variety

This revealed distinct behavioural customer personas such as:

Core stable buyers

VIP heavy buyers

Operational risk customers

5️⃣ Supporting Revenue Regression

A linear regression model was built to understand numerical revenue drivers.
Key findings:

Order frequency, product variety, and order value were the strongest predictors.

Shipping reliability showed low direct revenue impact but high churn and risk segmentation value.

📊 Key Business Insights

A high-revenue customer segment was identified that is operationally at risk due to poor shipping performance.

Logistics failures impact customer stability before impacting revenue.

Behavioural clustering helped separate growth customers from decline-risk customers.

Revenue is primarily driven by frequency and product diversity, not just order value.

✅ Business Impact

Improved targeting for customer retention campaigns

Prioritised logistics audits for high-revenue risk customers

Data-backed upsell strategy for mid-tier customers

Executive-level visibility into revenue vs fulfilment trade-offs

📈 Dashboards (Power BI)

An executive-ready Power BI dashboard was built to visualise:

RFM customer distribution

Revenue by value tier

Shipping risk distribution

High-Value Fulfilment Risk customers

Behaviour-based customer clusters
